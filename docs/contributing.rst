Contributing
============

If you'd like to contribute to circleguard, pull requests are always welcome!

I do a decent job of keeping track of issues through the `circlecore github <https://github.com/circleguard/circlecore/issues>`_;
find one that interests you and give it a shot. You can also always ask what you can help with on
`the discord <https://discord.gg/VNnkTjm>`_. I don't bite, I promise :)
