Contributing
============

We are an open source project, and contributions are more than welcome.

We try to keep track of issues through the
`circlecore github <https://github.com/circleguard/circlecore/issues>`_,
but aren't always the most rigorous about it. The best way to find out
how you can help is to ask on `our discord <https://discord.gg/VNnkTjm>`_. We
don't bite, I promise!

We have a long-standing
`offer by peppy <https://github.com/circleguard/circlecore/issues/23>`_ to
integrate circleguard into osu!, which requires circleguard to be written in
c#. Our primary language will remain python (we simply don't have the manpower
to support both languages at the moment), but if you are interested in
rewriting circlecore in c#, let us know.
