class Comparer:
    """
    Manages comparing :class:`~.replay.Replay`\s for replay stealing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    replays1: list[:class:`~circleguard.loadable.Replay`]
        The replays to compare against either ``replays2`` if ``replays2`` is
        not ``None``, or against other replays in ``replays1``.
    replays2: list[:class:`~circleguard.loadable.Replay`]
        The replays to compare against ``replays1``.
    num_chunks: int
        How many chunks to split the replay into when comparing. This
        parameter only has an affect if ``detect`` is ``Detect.STEAL_CORR``.
        Note that runtime increases linearly with the number of chunks.


    Notes
    -----
    If ``replays2`` is passed, each replay in ``replays1`` is compared against
    each replay in ``replays2``. Otherwise, each replay in ``replays1`` is
    compared against each other replay in ``replays1``
    (``len(replays1) choose 2`` comparisons).

    The order of ``replays1`` and ``replays2`` has no effect; comparing 1 to 2
    is the same as comparing 2 to 1.

    replays.
