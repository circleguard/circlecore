# We define our own hitobjects as the slider library's hitobjects have too many
# attributes and methods we don't care about, and they also lock position
# behind an extra attribute access (``hitobj.position.x``` vs ``hitobj.x``)
# which I'm not a fan of.
# Another necessary change is our hitobjects are "replay/map aware", which means
# they know how large they are (or potentially how difficult they are to hit
# as a result of OD if that is necessary in the future) and where they are (for
# HR) because we know with what mods and on what map the hitobject was played
# with.
