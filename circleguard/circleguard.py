    Parameters
    ----------
    key: str
        A valid api key. Can be retrieved from https://osu.ppy.sh/p/api/.
    db_path: str or :class:`os.PathLike`
        The path to the database file to read and write cached replays. If the
        path does not exist, a fresh database will be created there.
        If `None`, no replays will be cached or loaded from cache.
    slider_dir: str or :class:`os.PathLike`
        The path to the directory used by :class:`slider.library.Library` to
        store beatmaps. If `None`, a temporary directory will be created for
        :class:`slider.library.Library` and subsequently destroyed when this
        :class:`~Circleguard` object is garbage collected.
    loader: :class:`~circleguard.loader.Loader`
        This loader will be used instead of the base loader if passed.
        This must be the class itself, *not* an instantiation of it. It will be
        instantiated with two args - a key and a cacher.

        ----------
