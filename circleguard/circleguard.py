    Circleguard is the main entry point for using circlecore. In particular, we
    provide methods to calculate various statistics about
    :class:`~circleguard.loadables.Replay`\s:

    * :meth:`~.similarity` - the similarity between two replays.
    * :meth:`~.ur` - the unstable rate of a replay.
    * :meth:`~.snaps` - any unusual snaps in the cursor movement of a replay.
    * :meth:`~.frametime` - the average frametime of a replay.
    * :meth:`~.frametimes` - a list of the time between frames of a replay.
    * :meth:`~.hits` - the locations in a replay where a hitobject is hit.

    We also provide methods to interact with
    :class:`~circleguard.loadables.Loadable`\s:

    * :meth:`~.load` - loads a :class:`~circleguard.loadables.Loadable`.
    * :meth:`~.load_info` - loads the info of a
      :class:`~circleguard.loadables.ReplayContainer`.
    * :meth:`~.Map` - creates a new :class:`~circleguard.loadables.Map` and
      loads its info.
    * :meth:`~.User` - creates a new :class:`~circleguard.loadables.User` and
      loads its info.
    * :meth:`~.MapUser` - creates a new :class:`~circleguard.loadables.MapUser`
      and loads its info.

      :class:`~circleguard.loadables.ReplayDir` and loads its info.

    Parameters
    ----------
    key: str
        A valid api key. Can be retrieved from https://osu.ppy.sh/p/api/.
    db_path: str or :class:`os.PathLike`
        The path to the database file to read and write cached replays. If the

    slider_dir: str or :class:`os.PathLike`
        The path to the directory used by :class:`slider.library.Library` to
        store beatmaps. If ``None``, a temporary directory will be created for

        :class:`~Circleguard` object is garbage collected.
    loader: :class:`~circleguard.loader.Loader`
        An instance of :class:`~circleguard.loader.Loader` or a subclass

        The similarity between ``replay1`` and ``replay2``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        replay1: :class:`~circleguard.loadables.Replay`
            The replay to compare against ``replay2``.
        replay2: :class:`~circleguard.loadables.Replay`
            The replay to compare against ``replay1``.
        method: {"similarity", "correlation"}
            What method to use to calculate the similarity between the replays.
            |br|
            ``similarity`` is (roughly speaking) the average distance
            between the two replays in pixels. A replay compared to itself (or
            an exact copy) has a similarity of 0. See
            :data:`~circleguard.Circleguard.SIM_LIMIT` for a suggested number
            where similarities below this number indicate a stolen replay.
            |br|
            ``correlation`` is a signal-processing metric which measures how
            similar two signals (or replays, in our case) are. Correlation also
            takes into account time shifts, so a replay which is a perfect copy
            of another replay but consistently lags 10 ms behind will still have
            a perfect correltion of ``1``. The higher correlation, the more
            correlated (or similar) the two replays are. See
            :data:`~circleguard.Circleguard.CORR_LIMIT` for a suggested number
            where correlations above this number indicate a stolen replay.
        num_chunks: int
            How many chunks to split the replay into when comparing. This
            parameter only has an affect if ``method`` is ``correlation``.
            Note that runtime increases linearly with the number of chunks.
        mods_unknown: {"best", "both"}
            What to do if one or both of ``replay1`` and ``replay2`` do not
            know what mods they were played with. In this case, the similarity
            will be computed twice, both with no modifications and with
            ``Mod.HR`` applied to ``replay1``.
            |br|
            If ``best`` is passed, the best (that is, lowest if ``method`` is
            ``similarity`` and highest if ``method`` is ``correlation``)
            similarity of these two calculations is returned.
            |br|
            If ``both`` is passed, a tuple with two floats is returned. The
            first element is the similarity with no modifications, and the
            second element is the similarity with ``Mod.HR`` applied to
            ``replay1``.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            If ``method`` is ``similarity``, this is the similarity of the two
            replays. If ``method`` is ``correlation``, this is the correlation
            between the two replays.
        (float, float)
            If ``mods_unknown`` is ``both``, a tuple with two floats
            is returned. The first element is the similarity with no
            modifications, and the second element is the similarity with

        Parameters
        ----------
        replay: :class:`~circleguard.loadables.Replay`
            The replay to graph the frametimes of.
        cv: bool
            Whether the frametimes should be converted before being graphed.
        figure: :class:`matplotlib.figure.Figure`
            If passed, this figure will be used instead of creating a new one
            with pyplot. Using this parameter is not recommended for normal
            usage. It is exposed to allow circleguard (the gui) to use this
            method, as matplotlib's pyqt compatability layer adds some
            complications which this works around.
        show_expected_frametime: bool
